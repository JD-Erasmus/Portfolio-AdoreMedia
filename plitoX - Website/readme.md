# Introduction

Welcome to the "PlitoX" project, where I embarked on a mission to revamp the front end of our client's website. Starting with a design concept crafted in Figma (see [Figma design file](figma.md)). The next step involved customizing an HTML template and adapting it to realize the client's vision through careful HTML, CSS, and JavaScript editing. 

# Project Background
## Client's Request
The client initially requested a front-end redesign for their website, with a primary emphasis on enhancing performance and SEO, in addition to achieving improved responsiveness.

## Design Concept
To meet this request, I began by creating a design concept using Figma. Explore the detailed, minimal design of the PlitoX home page in the [Figma design file](figma.md). The client approved this concept, paving the way for the next stages of the project.

## HTML Template
Subsequently, the client provided an HTML template that came pre-built with multiple pages, which could be customized through HTML/CSS/JavaScript editing for the desired redesign.

## Content Migration
Besides the redesign, our focus was on migrating content from the old website to the new one. The primary objective was to visually showcase the client's products and services offered on the original site.

# The Design Process

## Research
In the research phase, we dedicated extensive efforts to grasp the client's distinctive style and brand, a pivotal aspect of the project. The client's vision emphasized a high-tech and professional appearance for the site.

## Collaboration
A collaborative approach was adopted, fostering open communication with the client. Their feedback and insights played an integral role in shaping the final design.

## Presentation
After completing the design, collaborative sessions were conducted with the client. The goal was not only to meet their requirements but also to co-create a vision that exceeded their expectations.

# Implementation

## Code Review
Implementing the project involved reading through the code of the template to identify and manipulate prebuilt classes, CSS, and HTML elements to create a custom design that aligned with the client's vision.

## Custom Code and Components
The development of custom code and components was essential, incorporating new features and elements to meet the client's specific requirements.

## Responsive Design
Bootstrap played a pivotal role in achieving a responsive design that looked and functioned seamlessly on various screen sizes and devices. Additionally, the use of SVGs contributed to improved responsiveness, performance, and faster load times due to their smaller file size, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Challenges and Bug Fixing
Creating custom components presented challenges when working with prebuilt HTML code. These challenges often required bug fixing to maintain functionality and design integrity. The process demanded a comprehensive understanding of the code, which I successfully achieved through meticulous code reviews and thorough examination of the template's documentation. 

# Outcomes
The "PlitoX" project successfully met the client's needs and exceeded expectations. Collaborative efforts ensured the project precisely met the client's requirements, while custom code and components were implemented to realize their unique vision. Performance and SEO goals were achieved, and a responsive design was delivered.
