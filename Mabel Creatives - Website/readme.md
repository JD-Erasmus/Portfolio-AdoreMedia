## Introduction
Mabel Creatives is a design project that emerged as an exciting journey of transforming a client's vision into a visually captivating web solution. This project showcases my design skills and ability to translate creative concepts into reality.

## Project Background
The project began without any implementation but with the client's color palette in hand. My initial task was to conduct in-depth research on the client to create a design that perfectly aligned with their style and brand identity. This research phase was essential in understanding the client's goals and objectives.

The client, an umbrella company, has a vision to create a unified digital presence. This vision includes a main site that acts as the central hub, connecting seamlessly to four distinct subsites. Each subsite represents a unique company under the umbrella, offering specialized services. The challenge was to design a cohesive web solution that harmonizes these diverse entities while maintaining their individual identities.

This ambitious undertaking required in-depth planning, strategic design, and an unwavering commitment to delivering a web solution that seamlessly integrates the main site with the four subsites.

## The Design Process
I embraced the challenge of crafting a design that not only met the client's requirements but also exceeded their expectations. Here's how I navigated the design process:

### Research:
Extensive research helped me gain insights into the client's industry, competitors, and target audience. This understanding was foundational for creating a design that resonated with the client's goals.

### Collaboration:
I strongly believe in the power of co-design, where developers and clients work hand in hand to create exceptional web solutions. Throughout the project, I maintained open communication with the client, fostering a collaborative atmosphere. Their feedback and insights were not just welcomed but actively encouraged, as they played a crucial role in shaping the final design.

This collaborative approach ensures that the web solution isn't developed in isolation but is a result of a shared vision. It allows for real-time adjustments and improvements, leading to a design that aligns perfectly with the client's style and brand identity.

### Presentation:
After completing the design, I believe in the value of sitting down with the client to hear their ideas, feedback, and aspirations. The goal extends beyond just meeting their requirements; it's about co-creating a vision that exceeds their expectations.

Through collaborative sessions and brainstorming, we harness the power of the design file to visualize those ideas. It's much easier to form a completed vision when you have something tangible to look at, and this is where the design file plays a pivotal role. It becomes a canvas for creativity, a foundation for discussion, and a catalyst for turning ideas into reality.

## Implementation
I didn't stop at design. I also implemented the website on WordPress, bringing the design to life. You can explore the live website [here](https://mabelcreatives.com). 

## Outcomes
The project culminated in a design that left the client thoroughly impressed. It's a testament to my ability to transform a vision into a visually captivating web solution that aligns perfectly with the client's style and brand identity.
