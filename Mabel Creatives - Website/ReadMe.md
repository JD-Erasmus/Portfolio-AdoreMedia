## Overview

Mabel Creatives was a unique design project where I was handed the reins to craft a web design from the ground up. Initially, no implementation had taken place, but I was provided with a color palette and tasked with conducting research on the client to create a design that perfectly aligned with their style and brand identity.

After thorough research and a collaborative meeting with the client, I presented them with the design, and I'm delighted to say that they were thoroughly impressed with the results. This project showcases not just my design skills, but also my ability to understand a client's vision and translate it into a visually captivating web solution.

The design embodies my commitment to creating web experiences that resonate with the client's goals and leave a lasting impression on their audiences. Through this project, I demonstrated my capacity to turn a creative vision into a reality, ensuring both client satisfaction and an exceptional user experience.
